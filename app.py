  Stability requirements:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - For cryopreserved cell therapies, FDA expects a phase-appropriate stability program covering **frozen storage**, **shipping simulation**, and **postâ€‘thaw hold**; expiry should be dataâ€‘justified and linked to key quality attributes (e.g., potency, viability, identity, purity).
          - Methods used to judge stability should be at a validation level appropriate to the claim at that stage; lateâ€‘stage claims should align with validated methods.
        What FDA expects:
          - A matrix showing **materials (DS/DP/intermediates)** Ã— **conditions** Ã— **time points** Ã— **attributes**; include shipping/transport simulations and worstâ€‘case postâ€‘thaw holds.
          - Trend analyses for potency/viability and other critical attributes with predefined rules for actions when trends break.
          - A clear **expiry rationale** (trendâ€‘based and/or capabilityâ€‘based) and linkage to final **release specifications**.
        Checklist:
          - Define matrix (e.g., DP at 0,1,3,6,9,12 months; postâ€‘thaw holds; shipping sim).
          - Lock acceptance/alert limits; plan for excursions and reâ€‘testing rules.
          - Ensure analytical methods are stabilityâ€‘suitable (range/precision) and controls reference strategy is defined.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.8.1** (protocols) â€¢ **3.2.P.8.2** (summary) â€¢ links to **3.2.P.5** (specs) and **3.2.P.5.3** (methods).
        Common pitfalls:
          - No shipping/hold simulation; expiry chosen without trend support; methods not fitâ€‘forâ€‘purpose.
        Reviewer questions:
          - How does the shipping model bound worstâ€‘case lanes? What is the postâ€‘thaw time budget to dose?
        Example language:
          - "Expiry is justified by trend analysis of potency and viability through 12 months at âˆ’150â€¯Â°C, with shipping and 4â€‘hour postâ€‘thaw holds meeting predefined criteria."

  Shipper validation:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects **package system qualification** demonstrating temperature control for the labeled claim, typically using a staged **IQ/OQ/PQ** approach with worstâ€‘case payloads and lanes.
        What FDA expects:
          - Thermal mapping with calibrated probes; **preâ€‘conditioning** steps defined; runs representing **ambient extremes** (summer/winter) and stress (altitude/handling).
          - **Ongoing control**: change control, **requalification cadence**, lane monitoring, and excursion management/SOPs.
        Checklist:
          - IQ: shipper specification/identity and setup; OQ: lab thermal testing; PQ: full endâ€‘toâ€‘end distribution simulation or live qualification with retained probes.
          - Define acceptance (e.g., **all probes within label range** for duration + margins); include shock/vibration/altitude as applicable.
          - Document **LNâ‚‚/Dryâ€‘ice** handling, charging, hold times, and tamper/tilt indicators where used.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.3.5** (validation reports) â€¢ **3.2.P.3** manufacturing description references â€¢ related SOPs in Module 1/5 as appropriate.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Qualification only at nominal ambient; inadequate payload definition; missing probe calibration; lack of requalification plan.
        Reviewer questions:
          - What data supports label claims across lanes and seasons? How are excursions detected and dispositioned?
        Example language:
          - "PQ demonstrated â‰¥120â€¯h within âˆ’150â€¯Â±â€¯10â€¯Â°C across 10 probes under summer/winter profiles using worstâ€‘case payload; requalification annually or upon significant change."

  Number of lots in batch analysis:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects **comprehensive batch analysis tables** in CTD summarizing **all available lots** (clinical, PPQ/commercial) with descriptive statistics to support **specification justification**; the exact lot count is **riskâ€‘ and dataâ€‘dependent**.
        What FDA expects:
          - Present **preâ€‘PPQ clinical lots** and **PPQ lots**; show n, mean, SD, range, % outliers, and rationale for proposed limits.
          - Discuss **capability** evidence and how PPQ acceptance relates to final specs and control strategy.
        Checklist:
          - Collect raw results for **each attribute** (potency, identity, purity, safety) across all relevant lots.
          - Provide trend/control charts for key attributes; note any **process changes** and comparability outcomes.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.5.1** (specs) â€¢ **3.2.P.5.6** (justification) â€¢ **3.2.P.3.5** (process validation/PPQ linkage) â€¢ comparability in **3.2.S/P.2.7** as relevant.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Treating early clinical data as nonâ€‘informative; too few lots to justify tight specs without clinical linkage; missing linkage to PPQ.
        Reviewer questions:
          - How do lots spanning process changes compare? What is the clinical relevance of the proposed limits?
        Example language:
          - "Specification limits are set using pooled clinical and PPQ data (n=XX) with capability evidence; margins reflect clinical and method variability; comparability confirms no shift postâ€‘change."
        References:
          - ICH Q6B / Q2(R2) / Q14.

  APS / Aseptic Process Validation:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects **aseptic process simulations (APS/media fills)** to mirror **worstâ€‘case duration and interventions**, with **Grade A/ISO 5** at point of operation and background commensurate with open processing (typically ISO 7). Personnel qualification and **EM trending** are essential.
        What FDA expects:
          - Three successful APS runs representing max duration, shift change (if applicable), and the full **intervention set** (connections, replenishments, atypical events) with predefined **acceptance criteria (0 positives)**.
          - **Airflow visualization** (smoke studies), line clearance, and **container closure integrity (CCIT)** aligned to final configuration.
        Checklist:
          - Intervention list and rationale; run duration; personnel qualification; acceptance; requalification triggers; deviation handling.
          - EM plan (viable/nonâ€‘viable, personnel, surfaces) with alert/action levels and trending approach.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.3.5** (APS protocols/reports) â€¢ **3.2.P.3** (manufacturing description) â€¢ crossâ€‘refs to **P.2** (CCIT rationale).
        Common pitfalls:
          - APS shorter than commercial duration; missing highâ€‘risk interventions; weak deviation/risk assessment; lack of requalification plan.
        Reviewer questions:
          - Which interventions are most contaminationâ€‘prone and how are they simulated? What justifies the run length?
        Example language:
          - "Three APS runs covering 12â€¯h with shift change and full intervention set met acceptance (0 positives); personnel requalified semiâ€‘annually; CCIT verified on final configuration."

  Potency matrix (phase-appropriate):
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects **MoAâ€‘linked multiâ€‘attribute potency** with **system suitability**, **reference strategy**, and a **lifecycle plan** (feasibility â†’ qualification â†’ validation). Early phases emphasize trending; BLA requires **dataâ€‘justified criteria**.
        What FDA expects:
          - Attributes spanning **activation**, **cytotoxic function**, and **supportive cytokines** as appropriate; **orthogonal** coverage and predefined **guardrails**.
          - Clear triggers for moving from **reportâ€‘results**/guardrails to **specification** limits; capability/control charts to justify criteria.
        Checklist:
          - Define panel and MoA linkage; reference control; guardrails; variability plan; validation roadmap.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.5.1** (specs) â€¢ **3.2.P.5.3** (methods) â€¢ **3.2.P.5.6** (justification) â€¢ summary in **3.2.P.2**.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Single cytokine as sole potency; no guardrails; high variability without controls; late changes without comparability.
        Reviewer questions:
          - How do assay readouts track with clinical response? What capability supports criteria?
        Example language:
          - "The potency matrix comprises activation and cytotoxic readouts with system suitability and a referenceâ€‘managed control chart; acceptance criteria are derived from capability of Phase 3 + PPQ lots."
        References:
          - CMC Information for Human Gene Therapy INDs (2020).
          - ICH Q2(R2) / Q14.

  Comparability â€” decision rules:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects a **predefined, riskâ€‘based comparability plan** with **equivalence statistics** where appropriate, **orthogonal potency**, and **failâ†’action** rules that tie to specs, stability, and clinical risk.
        What FDA expects:
          - **Pre/post change** lot sets sized by **power analysis**; predefined **margins** and success criteria; clear statistical methods.
          - Integration with **stability** and **release**; documentation of impact to **control strategy**.
        Checklist:
          - Decision tree; lot counts; statistical plan; data integration (release + stability); action plan on fail.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.S/P.2.7** (comparability protocol & data) â€¢ **3.2.P.5.6** (spec justification links).
        Common pitfalls:
          - Postâ€‘hoc margin setting; inadequate lot numbers; ignoring assay variability; unmapped CTD crossâ€‘refs.
        Reviewer questions:
          - What is the clinical meaning of the margins? How sensitive is the method to detect meaningful shifts?
        Example language:
          - "The protocol prespecifies 8 pre/8 post lots with equivalence margins linked to clinical relevance and method variability; outcomes drive predefined actions to specs and process controls."
        References:
          - ICH Q5E.
          - CMC Information for Human Gene Therapy INDs (2020).

  PPQ readiness & BLA content:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - BLA requires evidence of **process validation/PPQ** and **state of control** with crossâ€‘links to the **control strategy** and **specifications**; narratives must be cohesive and searchable.
        What FDA expects:
          - PPQ protocol & report covering **sampling plan**, acceptance criteria, **deviations/CAPA**, and linkage to **commercial specs** with **capability** evidence.
          - Integrated **validation summary** for DS/DP and critical subsystems (e.g., fills, cryo).
        Checklist:
          - PPQ sampling plan; acceptance and deviations handling; capability/control charts; crossâ€‘refs to specs and control strategy.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.S.2.5 / 3.2.P.3.5** (validation & PPQ) â€¢ **3.2.P.5.6** (spec justification) â€¢ **Module 1** summaries as applicable.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Fragmented narratives; PPQ acceptance unrelated to specs; missing capability evidence; weak deviation rationale.
        Reviewer questions:
          - How do PPQ results demonstrate a state of control aligned to commercial specs?
        Example language:
          - "PPQ acceptance ties to commercial specs with capability â‰¥1.33 for potency and viability; deviations resolved with CAPA; control charts attached in the validation summary."
        References:
          - Process Validation â€” General Principles and Practices (2011).
          - CMC Information for Human Gene Therapy INDs (2020).

  Release specifications (phase-appropriate):
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - **Phaseâ€‘appropriate specs** evolve from **reportâ€‘results/guardrails** to **validated acceptance criteria** at BLA, aligned to MoA and capability; limits must reflect **clinical relevance** and method performance.
        What FDA expects:
          - Justification using pooled **clinical + PPQ** data with **capability**; alignment to **potency/stability risk**; system suitability & reference strategy defined.
        Checklist:
          - Attribute list (potency, ID, purity, safety); rationale; data summary; limits; OOS/OOT handling; change control link.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.5.1** (specs) â€¢ **3.2.P.5.6** (justification) â€¢ crossâ€‘refs to **3.2.P.5.3** (methods) and **3.2.P.8** (stability).
        Common pitfalls:
          - Limits set without data; overâ€‘tight specs; lack of linkage to PPQ; no plan for variability.
        Reviewer questions:
          - What data supports each limit? How do limits relate to clinical benefit and assay variability?
        Example language:
          - "Acceptance limits for potency and viability are based on pooled clinical and PPQ data with capability analysis; guardrails were retired when validation and clinical correlation were established."

Topics:
  Stability requirements:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - For cryopreserved cell therapies, FDA expects a phase-appropriate stability program covering frozen storage, shipping simulation, and postâ€‘thaw hold; expiry should be dataâ€‘justified and linked to key quality attributes (e.g., potency, viability, identity, purity).
        What FDA expects:
          - A matrix of DS/DP/intermediates Ã— conditions Ã— time points Ã— attributes; include shipping sims and worstâ€‘case postâ€‘thaw holds.
        Checklist:
          - Define matrix (0,1,3,6,9,12 mo etc), postâ€‘thaw holds, shipping sim; lock limits; ensure methods fit for purpose.
        CTD map:
          - 3.2.P.8.1 / 3.2.P.8.2 with links to 3.2.P.5 and 3.2.P.5.3.
        Example language:
          - Expiry justified by trends through 12 months at âˆ’150â€¯Â°C; shipping and 4â€‘hour postâ€‘thaw holds met predefined criteria.
        References:
          - CMC Information for Human Gene Therapy INDs (2020).
  Shipper validation:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects package system qualification (IQ/OQ/PQ) with worstâ€‘case payloads and lanes; ongoing control via requalification and monitoring.
        What FDA expects:
          - Thermal mapping with calibrated probes; preâ€‘conditioning; summer/winter extremes; stress profiles.
        Checklist:
          - IQ spec/setup; OQ lab thermal; PQ endâ€‘toâ€‘end; acceptance (all probes within label range); shock/altitude as applicable.
        CTD map:
          - 3.2.P.3.5 (validation) with references in 3.2.P.3.
        References:
          - Manufacturing Considerations for CGT Products (2015).
  Number of lots in batch analysis:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects comprehensive batch analysis tables of all available lots to justify specs; lot count is riskâ€‘ and dataâ€‘dependent.
        What FDA expects:
          - Present preâ€‘PPQ clinical + PPQ lots with stats; link to capability and control strategy.
        CTD map:
          - 3.2.P.5.1 / 3.2.P.5.6 with ties to 3.2.P.3.5.

  APS / Aseptic Process Validation:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - APS (media fills) mirror worstâ€‘case duration & interventions; personnel qualification; EM trending; CCIT alignment.
        What FDA expects:
          - Three successful runs; acceptance 0 positives; airflow visualization; full intervention set.
        References:
          - Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing (2004).
  Potency matrix (phase-appropriate):
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - MoAâ€‘linked multiâ€‘attribute potency with guardrails â†’ specs and a defined reference strategy; validation increases by phase.
        References:
          - CMC Information for Human Gene Therapy INDs (2020).
  Comparability â€” decision rules:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - Predefined, riskâ€‘based plan with equivalence statistics and failâ†’action rules; integrate stability and release.
        References:
          - ICH Q5E.
  PPQ readiness & BLA content:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - BLA shows PPQ and state of control linking to control strategy/specs; cohesive validation summary.
        References:
          - Process Validation â€” General Principles and Practices (2011).
  Release specifications (phase-appropriate):
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - RR/guardrails â†’ validated acceptance criteria at BLA; align to MoA and capability.

# CMC Chatbot (v3.8.6)

Regulatory CMC assistant focused on **Cell Therapy** and **LVV (Vector RM)** with six Quick Starters and a simplified sidebar.

- No downloads/templates section (UI is focused purely on guidance output).
- Headers are forced onto their own lines with blank lines before/after to avoid run-on formatting.

## Run locally
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

  Stability requirements:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - For cryopreserved cell therapies, FDA expects a phase-appropriate stability program covering **frozen storage**, **shipping simulation**, and **post‑thaw hold**; expiry should be data‑justified and linked to key quality attributes (e.g., potency, viability, identity, purity).
          - Methods used to judge stability should be at a validation level appropriate to the claim at that stage; late‑stage claims should align with validated methods.
        What FDA expects:
          - A matrix showing **materials (DS/DP/intermediates)** × **conditions** × **time points** × **attributes**; include shipping/transport simulations and worst‑case post‑thaw holds.
          - Trend analyses for potency/viability and other critical attributes with predefined rules for actions when trends break.
          - A clear **expiry rationale** (trend‑based and/or capability‑based) and linkage to final **release specifications**.
        Checklist:
          - Define matrix (e.g., DP at 0,1,3,6,9,12 months; post‑thaw holds; shipping sim).
          - Lock acceptance/alert limits; plan for excursions and re‑testing rules.
          - Ensure analytical methods are stability‑suitable (range/precision) and controls reference strategy is defined.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.8.1** (protocols) • **3.2.P.8.2** (summary) • links to **3.2.P.5** (specs) and **3.2.P.5.3** (methods).
        Common pitfalls:
          - No shipping/hold simulation; expiry chosen without trend support; methods not fit‑for‑purpose.
        Reviewer questions:
          - How does the shipping model bound worst‑case lanes? What is the post‑thaw time budget to dose?
        Example language:
          - "Expiry is justified by trend analysis of potency and viability through 12 months at −150 °C, with shipping and 4‑hour post‑thaw holds meeting predefined criteria."

  Shipper validation:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects **package system qualification** demonstrating temperature control for the labeled claim, typically using a staged **IQ/OQ/PQ** approach with worst‑case payloads and lanes.
        What FDA expects:
          - Thermal mapping with calibrated probes; **pre‑conditioning** steps defined; runs representing **ambient extremes** (summer/winter) and stress (altitude/handling).
          - **Ongoing control**: change control, **requalification cadence**, lane monitoring, and excursion management/SOPs.
        Checklist:
          - IQ: shipper specification/identity and setup; OQ: lab thermal testing; PQ: full end‑to‑end distribution simulation or live qualification with retained probes.
          - Define acceptance (e.g., **all probes within label range** for duration + margins); include shock/vibration/altitude as applicable.
          - Document **LN₂/Dry‑ice** handling, charging, hold times, and tamper/tilt indicators where used.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.3.5** (validation reports) • **3.2.P.3** manufacturing description references • related SOPs in Module 1/5 as appropriate.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Qualification only at nominal ambient; inadequate payload definition; missing probe calibration; lack of requalification plan.
        Reviewer questions:
          - What data supports label claims across lanes and seasons? How are excursions detected and dispositioned?
        Example language:
          - "PQ demonstrated ≥120 h within −150 ± 10 °C across 10 probes under summer/winter profiles using worst‑case payload; requalification annually or upon significant change."

  Number of lots in batch analysis:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects **comprehensive batch analysis tables** in CTD summarizing **all available lots** (clinical, PPQ/commercial) with descriptive statistics to support **specification justification**; the exact lot count is **risk‑ and data‑dependent**.
        What FDA expects:
          - Present **pre‑PPQ clinical lots** and **PPQ lots**; show n, mean, SD, range, % outliers, and rationale for proposed limits.
          - Discuss **capability** evidence and how PPQ acceptance relates to final specs and control strategy.
        Checklist:
          - Collect raw results for **each attribute** (potency, identity, purity, safety) across all relevant lots.
          - Provide trend/control charts for key attributes; note any **process changes** and comparability outcomes.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.5.1** (specs) • **3.2.P.5.6** (justification) • **3.2.P.3.5** (process validation/PPQ linkage) • comparability in **3.2.S/P.2.7** as relevant.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Treating early clinical data as non‑informative; too few lots to justify tight specs without clinical linkage; missing linkage to PPQ.
        Reviewer questions:
          - How do lots spanning process changes compare? What is the clinical relevance of the proposed limits?
        Example language:
          - "Specification limits are set using pooled clinical and PPQ data (n=XX) with capability evidence; margins reflect clinical and method variability; comparability confirms no shift post‑change."

  APS / Aseptic Process Validation:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects **aseptic process simulations (APS/media fills)** to mirror **worst‑case duration and interventions**, with **Grade A/ISO 5** at point of operation and background commensurate with open processing (typically ISO 7). Personnel qualification and **EM trending** are essential.
        What FDA expects:
          - Three successful APS runs representing max duration, shift change (if applicable), and the full **intervention set** (connections, replenishments, atypical events) with predefined **acceptance criteria (0 positives)**.
          - **Airflow visualization** (smoke studies), line clearance, and **container closure integrity (CCIT)** aligned to final configuration.
        Checklist:
          - Intervention list and rationale; run duration; personnel qualification; acceptance; requalification triggers; deviation handling.
          - EM plan (viable/non‑viable, personnel, surfaces) with alert/action levels and trending approach.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.P.3.5** (APS protocols/reports) • **3.2.P.3** (manufacturing description) • cross‑refs to **P.2** (CCIT rationale).
        Common pitfalls:
          - APS shorter than commercial duration; missing high‑risk interventions; weak deviation/risk assessment; lack of requalification plan.
        Reviewer questions:
          - Which interventions are most contamination‑prone and how are they simulated? What justifies the run length?
        Example language:
          - "Three APS runs covering 12 h with shift change and full intervention set met acceptance (0 positives); personnel requalified semi‑annually; CCIT verified on final configuration."

  Comparability — decision rules:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects a **predefined, risk‑based comparability plan** with **equivalence statistics** where appropriate, **orthogonal potency**, and **fail→action** rules that tie to specs, stability, and clinical risk.
        What FDA expects:
          - **Pre/post change** lot sets sized by **power analysis**; predefined **margins** and success criteria; clear statistical methods.
          - Integration with **stability** and **release**; documentation of impact to **control strategy**.
        Checklist:
          - Decision tree; lot counts; statistical plan; data integration (release + stability); action plan on fail.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.S/P.2.7** (comparability protocol & data) • **3.2.P.5.6** (spec justification links).
        Common pitfalls:
          - Post‑hoc margin setting; inadequate lot numbers; ignoring assay variability; unmapped CTD cross‑refs.
        Reviewer questions:
          - What is the clinical meaning of the margins? How sensitive is the method to detect meaningful shifts?
        Example language:
          - "The protocol prespecifies 8 pre/8 post lots with equivalence margins linked to clinical relevance and method variability; outcomes drive predefined actions to specs and process controls."

  PPQ readiness & BLA content:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - BLA requires evidence of **process validation/PPQ** and **state of control** with cross‑links to the **control strategy** and **specifications**; narratives must be cohesive and searchable.
        What FDA expects:
          - PPQ protocol & report covering **sampling plan**, acceptance criteria, **deviations/CAPA**, and linkage to **commercial specs** with **capability** evidence.
          - Integrated **validation summary** for DS/DP and critical subsystems (e.g., fills, cryo).
        Checklist:
          - PPQ sampling plan; acceptance and deviations handling; capability/control charts; cross‑refs to specs and control strategy.
        CTD map:
          - **3.2.S.2.5 / 3.2.P.3.5** (validation & PPQ) • **3.2.P.5.6** (spec justification) • **Module 1** summaries as applicable.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Fragmented narratives; PPQ acceptance unrelated to specs; missing capability evidence; weak deviation rationale.
        Reviewer questions:
          - How do PPQ results demonstrate a state of control aligned to commercial specs?
        Example language:
          - "PPQ acceptance ties to commercial specs with capability ≥1.33 for potency and viability; deviations resolved with CAPA; control charts attached in the validation summary."

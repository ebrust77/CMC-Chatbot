CRL Insights:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Public CRLs commonly cite potency rationale gaps, APS scope/acceptance, unclear comparability rules, PPQ readiness evidence, and CTD inconsistencies.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Tighten potency rationale; finalize APS acceptance; codify comparability rules; verify PPQ readiness; harmonize CTD.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - EMA feedback echoes FDA themes; ensure validation evidence and CTD mapping into MAA.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Plan Scientific Advice; align terminology/mapping; ensure validation narratives match MAA.
Stability:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Phase-appropriate matrices/time points; justify storage/shipping/hold; align method lifecycle to stability claims.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Lock matrix/limits; add shipping simulations; tie expiry to data trends.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Similar expectations; ensure MAA mapping; include DP shipping evidence.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Crosswalk CTD mapping to EU; confirm transport/hold studies.
Comparability:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Risk-based analytical matrix with predefined decision rules; scale to phase and impact.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Freeze decision tree, lot counts, margins; simulate outcomes; map to CTD.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Convergent with FDA; emphasize predefined rules and statistical justification.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Confirm EU-acceptable statistics/margins; align mapping to MAA.
Aseptic Process Validation (APV):
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - APS mirrors worst-case duration/interventions; personnel qualification; EM trending; CCIT aligned to final configuration.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Finalize intervention list; set acceptance; define requalification cadence; include airflow visualization.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Convergent expectations; ensure APS rationale matches EU aseptic simulation standards.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Align acceptance and personnel qualification with EU expectations.
PPQ in BLA:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Include DS/DP validation summaries, PPQ protocols/reports, predefined acceptance, deviation handling, and links to control strategy/specs.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Assemble integrated validation summary; ensure CTD cross-references are consistent.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Keep PPQ narratives consistent with MAA structure; ensure validation evidence is cohesive.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Crosswalk BLA→MAA mapping; fill EU-specific gaps.
Potency:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - MoA-linked multi-attribute panel; trend early; set criteria later; define guardrails and reference strategy.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Define RR→Spec triggers; add orthogonal potency; establish reference strategy and control charts.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Convergent with FDA; ensure validation level and potency narrative fit EU expectations.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Harmonize acceptance rationale and lifecycle documents for MAA.

    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Use report-only (RR) for characterization/non-disposition tests; apply acceptance criteria to disposition-critical assays (identity, sterility, mycoplasma, endotoxin, where applicable potency).
          - Define explicit triggers to convert RR→Spec (e.g., ≥10–20 consecutive lots, method qualification, capability ≥ Cpk 1.33, stability evidence, clinical exposure milestones).
        What reviewers look for:
          - A one-page RR→Spec matrix listing assay, phase status, trigger, and target phase for criteria; alignment to batch disposition practice and CoA.
          - CTD text that is consistent (S/P sections) and avoids implying criteria where none exist.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Treating a CQA-critical assay as RR without a time-bound conversion plan; inconsistency between Module 3 and actual release decisions.
        Checklist:
          - [ ] Identify disposition-critical assays vs characterization.
          - [ ] Define numeric triggers for RR→Spec.
          - [ ] Ensure CoA language matches Module 3.
          - [ ] Plan bridging if the readout/platform changes.
        CTD Map:
          - Place specification rationale in S.4.5/P.5.6; methods in S.4.2/P.5.2; validation/qualification in S.4.3/P.5.3; summarize lifecycle in S/P.2.6–2.7.
        Examples:
          - Example RR→Spec row: Potency (cytotoxicity), Phase 1 = RR; Trigger = ≥12 conformance lots + method qualification + trend stability ≥ 6 months; Target = Phase 2 criteria.
          - Example language (Module 3): “The following readouts are reported without predefined acceptance criteria in Phase 1; acceptance thresholds will be introduced by Phase 2 based on capability and clinical experience.”
Aseptic Process Validation (APV):
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Demonstrate aseptic assurance via APS/media fills reflecting worst-case duration, interventions, and shift changes; qualify personnel; trend EM; align CCIT to final container/shipper.
        What reviewers look for:
          - APS protocols with predefined acceptance (units filled, incubation, turbidity thresholds), documented interventions, and smoke studies showing unidirectional flow.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Omitting high-risk interventions (e.g., aseptic connections, stopper/vial manipulations); APS duration shorter than commercial batch time.
        Checklist:
          - [ ] List planned & unplanned interventions; include worst-case.
          - [ ] Match APS duration to max batch time; include shift change.
          - [ ] Qualify all operators and key equipment; trend EM.
          - [ ] Align CCIT and transport simulation to final configuration.
        CTD Map:
          - Summarize APS in P.3.5; personnel/EM programs in P.3.3; CCIT in P.2/P.7; deviations/CAPA referenced in P.3.5.
        Examples:
          - Example APS acceptance: 3 simulations × ≥5,000 units each, 14-day incubation at 20–25°C then 30–35°C; 0 positives; interventions list includes aseptic connections, equipment adjustments, component replenishment.
CRL Insights:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Themes: potency matrix justification, APS coverage of worst-case interventions, clarity of specs vs validation/stability, PPQ readiness, and CTD consistency.
        What reviewers look for:
          - MoA-linkage for potency; APS evidence and CAPA closeout; defined comparability rules; PPQ protocols with predefined acceptance; cross-referenced CTD.
        Checklist:
          - [ ] Potency has orthogonal readouts tied to MoA.
          - [ ] APS covers worst-case with zero positives across simulations.
          - [ ] Specs align to validation/capability and are frozen before PPQ.
          - [ ] PPQ materials/sites/config identical to commercial.
        Examples:
          - Example CRL theme: “Provide justification for potency acceptance criteria or plan to introduce by Phase 2 with capability evidence.”
Comparability:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Use a risk-based analytical matrix (identity, purity/impurities, potency, safety) with predefined decision rules; scale with phase/impact.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Equivalence/acceptance logic, clinical relevance rationale, and traceability to specs; bridging plans if changes affect methods or process.
        Checklist:
          - [ ] Define matrix/acceptance ahead of change.
          - [ ] Capture pre/post lots and equivalence stats.

  LVV (Vector RM):
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Run LVV DS PPQ when process/analytics are locked and sites aligned; synchronize with DP needs so vector PPQ lots feed DP PPQ.
        What reviewers look for:

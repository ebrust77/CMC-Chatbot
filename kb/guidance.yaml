    Phase 1:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Use report-only (RR) selectively for **non–CQA** development/characterization tests while methods and ranges mature.
          - **Critical release tests** (e.g., identity, sterility, mycoplasma, endotoxin) typically require **acceptance criteria** even in Phase 1.
          - Potency used for **lot release control** should trend toward criteria; if RR early, state the **path to specs**.
        What reviewers look for:
          - A **table** listing each assay → RR vs Spec, with **risk-based rationale** and **phase-appropriate** plan.
          - **Triggers** to convert RR→Spec (e.g., N lots, method qualification, capability/stability evidence, clinical exposure).
          - CTD placement that is **consistent** across S/P sections; language that avoids implying criteria where none exist.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Treating a **CQA-critical assay** (e.g., sterility/potency if controlling release) as RR without clear plan to criteria.
          - RR language in **Module 3** that conflicts with batch disposition practice or CoA.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Build a one-page RR→Spec **matrix** (assay, phase status, trigger, target phase for criteria) and maintain it.
          - Pre-define **bridging** if a readout or platform changes while moving from RR to Spec.
    Phase 2:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Introduce **acceptance criteria** for assays that were RR in Phase 1 where data support thresholds.
          - Keep RR limited to characterization or **non–lot-disposition** tests.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Data-backed **justification** for thresholds; trending and capability indices if used.
          - Clear **change management** if methods evolve during criteria introduction.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Update the matrix; align Spec language with **validation** and **stability** evidence.
    Phase 3 (Registrational):
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Lot-disposition–relevant assays are generally under **acceptance criteria**; RR reserved for characterization.
          - Specs should align with **validation** outcomes and **control strategy**.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Consistency across sites/lots; **comparability** support if method/process changed.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Freeze specs; ensure CTD consistency and PPQ linkages.
    Commercial:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Maintain **validated** methods and acceptance criteria; RR limited to characterization.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Ongoing verification/trending; change control for post-approval updates.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Periodic review of RR items and confirm they remain non-disposition.

CRL Insights:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Public CRLs highlight recurring CMC themes: potency justification, aseptic validation scope, comparability after changes, and PPQ readiness.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Tighten potency rationale; finalize APS; predefine comparability rules; document PPQ readiness.

Aseptic Process Validation (APV):
  Cell Therapy:
    Phase 1:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Define aseptic boundary and flows; targeted APS for high-risk steps; personnel/equipment qualification; EM plan.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Build toward late-phase APS at intended configuration.

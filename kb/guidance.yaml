CRL Insights:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Public CRLs commonly cite potency rationale gaps, APS scope/acceptance, unclear comparability rules, PPQ readiness evidence, and CTD inconsistencies.
        What reviewers look for:
          - MoA-linked potency matrix with data-driven criteria and system suitability.
          - APS covering worst-case duration and interventions; personnel qualification; EM trending.
          - Predefined comparability rules with statistics and margins.
          - PPQ readiness evidence (capability, control charts, deviations/CAPA outcomes).
          - Clean CTD cross-references across 3.2.S/3.2.P.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Single cytokine presented as 'potency' without MoA linkage.
          - APS shorter than commercial duration or missing key interventions.
          - Comparability plan without predefined pass/fail and actions.
          - PPQ evidence scattered across modules; unclear link to specs.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Tighten potency rationale; finalize APS acceptance; codify comparability rules; verify PPQ readiness; harmonize CTD.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - EMA feedback echoes FDA themes with emphasis on validation evidence and consistent CTD mapping into MAA.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Plan Scientific Advice; ensure EU terminology/mapping; align validation narratives to MAA structure.

Stability:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Phase-appropriate matrices/time points; justify storage/shipping/hold; align method lifecycle to stability claims.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Trends across potency/viability/ID/purity; alert/spec limits justified; transport/hold simulations; expiry rationale linked to data.
        Checklist:
          - Matrix table (DP/DS/intermediates), conditions, time points, attributes.
          - Trend plots and predefined action on trend breaks.
        CTD Map:
          - P.8.1 protocols; P.8.2 summary; links to P.5 specs and P.5.3 methods.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Lock matrix and limits; add shipping simulations; tie expiry to data trends.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Similar expectations; ensure format/terminology matches MAA; include DP shipping evidence.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Crosswalk CTD mapping to EU; confirm transport/hold studies coverage.

Comparability:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Risk-based analytical matrix with predefined decision rules; scale to phase and impact.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Pre/post lots with equivalence statistics; orthogonal potency measures; predefined fail→action rules.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Post-hoc rules; inadequate lot numbers; no linkage to specs or stability.
        CTD Map:
          - S/P.2.7 protocol/plan; S/P.4 data; P.5.6 spec justification; cross-ref to changes.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Freeze decision tree, sample size, margins; simulate outcomes; map to CTD.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Convergent with FDA; emphasize predefined rules and statistical justification.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Confirm EU-acceptable statistics/margins and mapping to MAA.

Aseptic Process Validation (APV):
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - APS mirrors worst-case duration/interventions; personnel qualification; EM trending; CCIT aligned to final configuration.
        Checklist:
          - Interventions list; max duration; shift change; replenishments/connections; acceptance criteria and requalification triggers.
        CTD Map:
          - P.3.3 manufacturing description; P.3.5 APS protocols/reports; P.2/CCIT cross-refs.
        Examples:
          - Three APS runs covering max duration + shift change; 0 positives; intervention set includes aseptic connections/replenishments.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Finalize intervention list; document airflow visualization; define requalification cadence.
      EU (EMA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Convergent expectations; ensure APS rationale matches EU standards for aseptic simulations.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Align acceptance and personnel qualification narrative with EU expectations.

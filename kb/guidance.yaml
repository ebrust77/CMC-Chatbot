  Stability requirements:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - For cryopreserved cell therapies, FDA expects a phase-appropriate stability program covering frozen storage, shipping simulation, and post‑thaw hold; expiry should be data‑justified and linked to key quality attributes (e.g., potency, viability, identity, purity).
        What FDA expects:
          - A matrix of DS/DP/intermediates × conditions × time points × attributes; include shipping sims and worst‑case post‑thaw holds.
        Checklist:
          - Define matrix (0,1,3,6,9,12 mo etc), post‑thaw holds, shipping sim; lock limits; ensure methods fit for purpose.

          - 3.2.P.8.1 / 3.2.P.8.2 with links to 3.2.P.5 and 3.2.P.5.3.
        Example language:
          - Expiry justified by trends through 12 months at −150 °C; shipping and 4‑hour post‑thaw holds met predefined criteria.

  Shipper validation:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects package system qualification (IQ/OQ/PQ) with worst‑case payloads and lanes; ongoing control via requalification and monitoring.
        What FDA expects:
          - Thermal mapping with calibrated probes; pre‑conditioning; summer/winter extremes; stress profiles.
        Checklist:
          - IQ spec/setup; OQ lab thermal; PQ end‑to‑end; acceptance (all probes within label range); shock/altitude as applicable.

  Number of lots in batch analysis:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - FDA expects comprehensive batch analysis tables of all available lots to justify specs; lot count is risk‑ and data‑dependent.
        What FDA expects:
          - Present pre‑PPQ clinical + PPQ lots with stats; link to capability and control strategy.

  APS / Aseptic Process Validation:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - APS (media fills) mirror worst‑case duration & interventions; personnel qualification; EM trending; CCIT alignment.
        What FDA expects:
          - Three successful runs; acceptance 0 positives; airflow visualization; full intervention set.

  Potency matrix (phase-appropriate):
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - MoA‑linked multi‑attribute potency with guardrails → specs and a defined reference strategy; validation increases by phase.

  Comparability — decision rules:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - Predefined, risk‑based plan with equivalence statistics and fail→action rules; integrate stability and release.

  PPQ readiness & BLA content:
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - BLA shows PPQ and state of control linking to control strategy/specs; cohesive validation summary.

  Release specifications (phase-appropriate):
    Cell Therapy:
      US (FDA):
        Summary:
          - RR/guardrails → validated acceptance criteria at BLA; align to MoA and capability.

CRL Insights:
  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Public CRLs (2019–2024 approvals) highlight recurring CMC themes: potency justification, aseptic validation scope, comparability after changes, and PPQ readiness.
          - Letters often request clearer CTD mapping, data traceability, and alignment of specs with validation and stability evidence.
        What reviewers look for:
          - MoA-linked potency matrices with acceptance rationale; justification for report-only items in early phase.
          - APS/media fill coverage of worst-case interventions and durations; EM/personnel qual trends and CAPA closeout.
          - Defined comparability matrices and decision rules; CTD consistency across S/P sections.
          - PPQ protocols with predefined criteria and deviation handling; site/material configuration identical to commercial.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Single-readout potency without orthogonal support; vague acceptance “ranges.”
          - APS that omit critical interventions or shift changes; weak CCIT link to final container/shipper.
          - Late specification freeze, missing bridging for method/process changes; inconsistent terminology between sections.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Tighten potency rationale; finalize APS scope and acceptance; predefine comparability rules and document PPQ readiness evidence.
  LVV (Vector RM):
    General:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - CRLs referencing vector supply frequently flag assay transfer/robustness, impurity profiles, and lot-to-lot variability.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Method lifecycle evidence at supplying sites; identity/potency/impurity clarity and acceptance logic.
          - Clear link between LVV attributes and cell therapy CQAs; sampling plans that support integration with DP specs.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Align LVV PPQ and method readiness with the cell therapy control strategy; ensure change notifications and bridging rules are in place.

Aseptic Process Validation (APV):
  Cell Therapy:
    Phase 1:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Define aseptic boundary and flows; perform targeted APS for high-risk steps; qualify personnel and equipment; establish EM plan.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Risk-based APS scope; smoke studies; intervention lists and worst-case logic; CCIT strategy consistent with storage/shipping.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Build toward late-phase APS at intended configuration; document deviations and retraining triggers.
    Phase 2:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Expand APS to intended configuration and duration; include planned/unplanned interventions; strengthen EM/personnel trending.
        What reviewers look for:
          - APS protocols with acceptance criteria; airflow visualization; action/alert levels tied to risk.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Lock configuration for registrational APS; align with DP filling/packaging steps.
    Phase 3 (Registrational):
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Execute APS (media fills) at commercial sites/scales with worst-case coverage; finalize CCIT verification and transport simulation.
        What reviewers look for:
          - APS reports, deviations/CAPA, successful personnel qualifications, EM trends supporting sterility assurance.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Place APS and CCIT summaries in CTD (e.g., P.3.5/P.7 as applicable); define ongoing verification plan.
    Commercial:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Maintain validated state with periodic APS and CPV/OPV indicators; manage changes via change control.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Trend reviews and revalidation triggers; alignment of deviations/CAPA to aseptic performance.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Schedule periodic media fills per policy; update risk assessments after configuration/personnel changes.

PPQ Timing (LVV DS):
  LVV (Vector RM):
    Phase 2:
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Mature LVV DS process/analytics; align sites and materials; lock configuration leading into PPQ.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Site readiness, material control, and method robustness.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Prepare PPQ protocols for DS lots supplying Cell Therapy.
    Phase 3 (Registrational):
      Global:
        Guidance Summary:
          - Execute LVV DS PPQ at commercial sites/scales; integrate sampling/acceptance with Cell Therapy requirements.
        What reviewers look for:
          - Protocols, predefined acceptance, deviations handling; linkage to control strategy.

          - Complete PPQ and compile reports before BLA or per agreement.

PPQ in BLA:
  Cell Therapy:
    Phase 3 (Registrational):

        Guidance Summary:
          - Include DS/DP process validation summaries (e.g., 3.2.S.2.5 / 3.2.P.3.5), PPQ protocols/reports, and rationale.
          - Traceability from development to control strategy and specs is expected.
        What reviewers look for:
          - PPQ acceptance vs predefined criteria, deviations assessment, and comparability bridging.
        Suggested next steps:
          - Prepare integrated validation summary; ensure CTD cross-references are consistent.

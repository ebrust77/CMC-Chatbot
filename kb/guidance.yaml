  Cell Therapy:
    General:
      US (FDA):
        Guidance Summary:
          - Use report-only (RR) for characterization/non-disposition tests; apply acceptance criteria to disposition-critical assays (identity, sterility, mycoplasma, endotoxin, where applicable potency).
          - Define explicit triggers to convert RR→Spec (e.g., ≥10–20 lots, method qualification, capability ≥ Cpk 1.33, stability evidence, clinical exposure milestones).
        What reviewers look for:
          - An RR→Spec matrix listing assay, phase status, trigger, and target phase for criteria; alignment to batch disposition practice and CoA.
          - CTD text that is consistent (S/P sections) and avoids implying criteria where none exist.
        Common pitfalls:
          - Treating a CQA-critical assay as RR without a time-bound plan; inconsistency between Module 3 and actual release decisions.
        Checklist:
          - [ ] Identify disposition-critical assays vs characterization.
          - [ ] Define numeric triggers for RR→Spec.
          - [ ] Ensure CoA language matches Module 3.
          - [ ] Plan bridging if the readout/platform changes.
